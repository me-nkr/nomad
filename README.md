# Nomad
Exploration, experimentation, and journey to the unknowns.

This is a neovim config, my first custom config actually.

## To Use
- Install vim-plug [form here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- Go to `~/.config/nvim/lua` and clone this repo
- Edit `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` and add `require('nomad')` and comment out everything else
- Open neovim and run `:PlugInstall`
- Close and open neovim ( or use `:RC` )
- Viola you witness the journey

## Custom commands
- `:RC` to apply updated config to a open buffer
