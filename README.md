# Nomad
Exploration, experimentation, and journey to the unknowns.

This is a neovim config, my first custom config actually.

## To Use
- Go to `~/.config/nvim/lua` and clone this repo
- Edit `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` and add `require('nomad')` and comment out everything else
- Open neovim and viola you witness the journey

## Custom commands
- `:RC` to apply updated config to a open buffer
